                    <p>
                        Songe LaRon is the Co-Founder and CEO of SQUIRE Technologies. Founded in 2015,
                        SQUIRE created a new software category- barbershop business management- to
                        reinvent the way daily operations are handled and give barbers and shop owners the
                        tools they need for the business side of barbering. Today, SQUIRE delivers the only
                        all-in-one barbershop management platform to over 3,000 barbershops— with 7.6
                        million clients having booked appointments through the platform.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        LaRon spent the early part of his career as a corporate lawyer. And, while he
                        experienced success, he yearned to put his energy towards the thing that mattered
                        most to him. He wanted to help build wealth in his community in a way that would
                        create a lasting impact.His vision was to use his business experience to help elevate an
                        industry that he knew played a critical role in all communities: the barbershop. He saw the
                        opportunity for barbershops to be more efficient and effective in running their businesses and
                        so he set out to build the tools they’d need to do it.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        In partnership with Co-Founder and President, Dave Salvant, he has led SQUIRE to
                        remarkable growth: the company is now valued at $750m after completing a Series
                        D fundraising round led by Tiger Global- increasing its valuation by 30x in two years.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        As CEO he believes it’s his job to be an innovator and uses that mindset to set
                        strategic direction for the company. He is proud of the incredible growth SQUIRE has
                        experienced taking on innovation for one of the oldest professions in the world, but is
                        most proud to have built a company that truly respects the value and impact of
                        barbershops on their communities while doing so. When asked what he wants to be remembered for,
                        LaRon says, “As someone who made a positive impact and changed people’s lives. Who really tried
                        to go big for something and succeeded. As someone who gave it his all.”
                        LaRon earned his J.D. from Yale Law School and graduated Cum Laude from UCLA with a degree in
                        Philosophy.
